Collection Notes

1. Difference between Arrays and ArrayLists?
Arrays have fixed size, which means ones you create an array, you must specify the size and that size
will never change i.e you cannot expand it or reduce it. If you are trying to add one more element to
your array where it was full, you need to create a new array where the size will be oldArray.length+1
With arrays, we are using [] to fetch elements or access elements on a specific index

With ArrayLists, we do not have to specify the size, the size will be managed dynamically, it will shrink
or expand automatically. With ArrayList, we are only using methods to access or to fetch elements
ArrayLIsts guarantee order, they save data in sequential order


ArrayList vs LinkedList

ArrayList uses a regular Array behind the scenes. It abstracts out from the user, all the adding and 
removing mechanisms, 

LinkedList however does not use a regular Array, instead it uses something called Nodes


Maps
Map interface has multiple implementation classes such as Hashtable, HashMap, LinkedHashMap, Properties

Hashmap is a poppular implementation class that is used in test automation because it performs much faster compared 
to hashtable. But Hashmap does not guarantee order.

When using maps, we have to specify key and value. Keys must be unique like sets, but values can be duplicate.
Keys in Map are always unique, which means even if you add keys multiple times, the last occurrence of that key will override
the previous value
Values in Map can be duplicate
